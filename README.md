# CSCI311F24
CSCI311 Fall 2024 - Stephan Takacs

As I have been doing less production development and more academic projects I realize my development skills for a larger project environment atrophy. I will use this repository to practice with github. It will contain all of my labs and projects from CSCI311. The inprogress branch will be used to work on projects locally and the main branch will contain all of my labs/projects for the class. 

### TO DO 
add readmes for all of the completed projects that contain the inginious scores
